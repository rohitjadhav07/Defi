## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Railway Build Fails
- Check `agent/package.json` has:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js"
  }
  ```

### Vercel Build Fails
- Make sure environment variables are set
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_API_URL` points to Railway

### Backend Not Responding
- Check GEMINI_API_KEY is set in Railway
- Check logs in Railway dashboard

### Frontend Can't Connect
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_API_URL` is correct
- Check CORS is enabled in backend (it is!)
